# jetbrains-academy-digital-flashcards
This project brings the proven learning method of flashcards into the digital age. By translating the physical process of studying with flashcards into an interactive application, users can leverage technology to improve their studying habits.

The application allows users to create, store, and manage flashcards each containing a term and its corresponding definition. It offers various functionalities including adding and removing flashcards, asking questions based on the flashcards, and tracking mistakes to identify which flashcards are proving to be more challenging.

Moreover, the program maintains a log of all actions and provides statistical insights, such as the "hardest card" which users often get wrong. This is especially useful for self-evaluation and focusing revision on problematic areas.

A standout feature of this project is the import/export functionality. Users can import flashcard data from external files, making it easy to share and exchange flashcard sets. It also supports exporting all the cards in the program memory into a file upon exit, ensuring that users can easily save and back up their data. This functionality even extends to command-line arguments, allowing for automated import and export.

This project is a step towards modern, digital study aids. By combining the time-tested methodology of flashcards with the advantages of digital technology, this application aims to make studying more efficient, personalized, and effective.
